# Todo app with React, but no JSX

In [Brian Holt's](https://twitter.com/holtbt) just finished course
for [FrontendMasters](https://frontendmasters.com), [Complete
Introduction to React](https://frontendmasters.com/workshops/intro-react-2/) (December
1 and 2, 2016), he introduces React from the bare essentials, with
just plain old JavaScript.

I was lucky enough to be moderating the course's chat room, but it
kept me hopping so much I had a hard time actually following along
with what Brian was teaching.

I could easily just run through his workshop materials, but I thought
it would be fun to give the traditional TODO application a go with
just plain old JavaScript using the React library: no transpilers, no
webpacking, keeping things in CommonJS form.

This should be fun!

I'm starting in from scratch, I'm not going to study the other
implementations, and see what I come up with. It won't be pretty, but
it will be instructive to me.
